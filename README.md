# ReMarkableCalendar
A convoluted python script to compile a LaTeX file with a linked calendar for use on the ReMarkable Tablet.
The pagesize is optimized for the tablet, and the week numbers as well as months are links, to allow for simple switching between the weeks and months.

The python script can be run as an executable or you can look inside to customize further.

The code is a mash up with modifications of this stack exchange answer:

and this template for the months:

Plus some formatting and adding links.
